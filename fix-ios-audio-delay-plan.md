# Plan to Fix Delayed iOS Audio Start

## Problem

On iOS devices, clicking the initial "Enter Digital Horizons" button does not immediately start the narrative audio. The audio only starts after a subsequent user interaction (e.g., clicking the pause button).

## Analysis

1.  **iOS Audio Policy:** iOS requires a direct user gesture (like a click or touch) to initiate audio playback or unlock the Web Audio API context.
2.  **Initial Interaction:** The "Enter Digital Horizons" button click in `LunarArrival.jsx` serves as the initial user gesture. This triggers the `resumeAudioContext` function in `AudioContext.jsx`.
3.  **Context Unlock:** `resumeAudioContext` attempts to unlock the audio context on iOS by playing a silent sound or using an oscillator.
4.  **Playback Request:** Almost simultaneously, `LunarArrival.jsx` updates state, causing `NarrativeReader.jsx` to mount and call `playAudioFile`.
5.  **Race Condition:** `playAudioFile` checks if the audio context is 'running'. If the iOS unlock process hasn't fully completed and the context state is still 'suspended', the playback request is deferred by storing it in the `pendingPlayback` state variable.
6.  **Deferred Playback:** The audio only plays later when either the `statechange` listener effect detects the context becoming 'running' or another user interaction potentially triggers a successful context resume.

## Proposed Fix

Modify the `resumeAudioContext` function in `src/contexts/AudioContext.jsx` to eliminate the delay:

1.  **Locate iOS Unlock Logic:** Find the section within `resumeAudioContext` (around lines 249-296) where the iOS audio unlock is performed (playing silent sound or oscillator) and `audioInitialized` is set to `true`.
2.  **Add Immediate Check:** Immediately after the point where the unlock is confirmed successful (e.g., after `setAudioInitialized(true)` or within the `.then()` block of the silent audio playback), add logic to check if the `pendingPlayback` state variable holds a deferred playback request.
3.  **Execute Pending Playback:** If `pendingPlayback` is not null, call the appropriate playback function (`playAudioWithToneRef.current` or `playAudioWithElementRef.current` based on the stored `isTone` flag) with the details from `pendingPlayback`.
4.  **Clear Pending State:** After initiating the deferred playback, set `pendingPlayback` back to `null`.

This ensures that as soon as the initial user gesture successfully unlocks the audio context, any waiting audio request is immediately processed.

    AC-->>NR: (Playback deferred)

    AC->>AC: iOS unlock completes -> setAudioInitialized(true)
    Note over AC: **Proposed Change:** Immediately check pendingPlayback here
    AC->>AC: If pendingPlayback exists, play it now & clear pendingPlayback
    AC-->>NR: (Audio starts playing immediately)
