# Audio Visualizer Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix issues with the audio visualizer, particularly on iOS, and to adjust its appearance and centering.

## Core Problem Areas Addressed:

1.  **iOS Analyzer Failure:** The previous hybrid approach using `Tone.Analyser` for iOS visualization was returning invalid data (`-Infinity`), causing the visualizer to fall back to simulated data.
2.  **Audio Context Lifecycle:** The audio context was potentially being closed prematurely, leading to errors when creating or connecting analyzer nodes.
3.  **Visual Appearance:** The visualizer shape wasn't strongly emphasizing the center bars ("voice-like"), and its centering was inconsistent.
4.  **Initial Spike (iOS):** A large visual spike occurred during the initial silent audio playback on iOS.

## Fixes Implemented:

1.  **Unified Audio Analysis (`AudioContext.jsx`):**
    *   Refactored the `playAudioWithTone` function (used for iOS) to stop using `Tone.Player` and `Tone.Analyser` for visualization.
    *   Now, it uses the standard Web Audio API `AnalyserNode` (`analyzerRef.current`), creating a `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` from the `iosAudioElement` (the element actually playing sound on iOS) and connecting it to the shared `analyzerRef`.
    *   This ensures the same reliable analysis method is used across platforms.

2.  **Global Audio Context (`AudioContext.jsx`):**
    *   Modified `initAudioContext` to use a global singleton (`window.globalAudioContext`) for the `AudioContext`.
    *   Updated the `useEffect` cleanup function to never close this global context, preventing "context closed" errors.

3.  **Visualizer Shape (`AudioVisualizer/index.jsx`):**
    *   Increased the exponent in the `positionFactor` calculation from `1.3` to `3.5` (line ~135) to make the height drop off more sharply from the center.
    *   Decreased the base value in `heightMultiplier` from `0.2` to `0.1` (line ~145) to further emphasize the center peak.

4.  **Visualizer Centering (`App.jsx`, `AudioVisualizer/index.jsx`, `AudioVisualizer.module.scss`):**
    *   Removed the JavaScript line that set `canvas.width` based on `window.innerWidth` (`AudioVisualizer/index.jsx`).
    *   Removed `position: absolute`, `left`, `top`, `transform` CSS properties from the `.visualizer` class (`AudioVisualizer.module.scss`). Added `margin: 0 auto;`.
    *   Removed `width: 100%` from the inline style of the `div` wrapping `<AudioVisualizer />` in `App.jsx`.
    *   Centering is now handled by the parent flexbox container in `App.jsx`.

5.  **Silent Audio File (`AudioContext.jsx`):**
    *   Changed the `silentAudio.src` for iOS unlock from `/audio/utils/silent.mp3` to `/audio/utils/silence.wav` (line ~201). (Note: The analyzer fixes likely resolved the spike issue, but using a cleaner file is still good practice).

## Outcome:

These changes resulted in a functional visualizer on both desktop and iOS, using real audio data, displaying the desired "voice-like" shape, correctly centered, and without the initial audio spike or context errors. Captions functionality was also restored.
