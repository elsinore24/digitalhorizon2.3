# Plan: Fix Asset Path Errors (v2)

This plan addresses the remaining 404 and `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors encountered for an audio file and an image file by correcting their paths and extensions in the relevant project files.

## Problem Identification (v2)

- **Audio Error:** Console logs show `GET http://audio/narration/flashback.mp3 net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`. This indicates the path `/audio/narration/flashback.mp3` (from `flashback_intro.json`) is being interpreted incorrectly, likely because the audio loading mechanism expects a path relative to `public` *without* the leading slash.
- **Image Error:** Console logs show `GET http://localhost:5173/front_pic/lab.png 404 (Not Found)`. The previous fix used the correct directory (`front_pic`) but the wrong extension (`.png` instead of `.jpg`) and included a leading slash which might also be incorrect for image loading.

## Revised Plan Steps

1.  **Adjust Audio Path in JSON:** Modify the `audio` path in `public/narratives/flashback_intro.json` to remove the leading slash.
    *   **File:** `public/narratives/flashback_intro.json`
    *   **Change:** Modify line 3 from `"audio": "/audio/narration/flashback.mp3",` to `"audio": "audio/narration/flashback.mp3",`
    *   **Tool:** `write_to_file` (providing full corrected content).
2.  **Adjust Image Path and Extension in Component:** Modify the `labBackgroundImage` constant in `src/scenes/LunarArrival/index.jsx` to remove the leading slash and use the correct `.jpg` extension.
    *   **File:** `src/scenes/LunarArrival/index.jsx`
    *   **Change:** Modify line 22 from `const labBackgroundImage = '/front_pic/lab.png';` to `const labBackgroundImage = 'front_pic/lab.jpg';`
    *   **Tool:** `apply_diff`.

## Investigation Flow (Summary)

Initial errors -> Checked code -> Found JSON syntax error & incorrect image path constant -> Applied fixes -> New errors (image 404, audio ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED) -> Re-evaluated paths -> Determined leading slashes likely incorrect & image extension wrong -> Revised plan.

## Next Steps

- Implement the revised changes using the specified tools in Code mode.
- Verify the fixes by running the application and checking the browser console for errors.
