# Plan: Fix `useCallback` ReferenceError in GameContainer.jsx

## Problem Analysis

The application fails to start due to an error: `Uncaught ReferenceError: useCallback is not defined` in `src/components/GameContainer.jsx`.

This occurred because the `useCallback` hook was used to define the `handleToggleDataPerception` function, but it was not imported from the 'react' library.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Modify `src/components/GameContainer.jsx`**:
    *   Locate the import statement from 'react' at the top of the file.
    *   Add `useCallback` to the list of imported hooks.

    ```diff
    - import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
    + import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'
    ```

## Expected Outcome

After applying this change, the `ReferenceError` will be resolved, and the application should start correctly. The audio resumption logic implemented previously should then be testable.

## Implementation Steps

1.  Switch to Code mode.
2.  Apply the diff to `src/components/GameContainer.jsx` to add the missing import.
3.  Verify the application starts without errors.
4.  Test the audio resumption functionality.
